Created a YouTube reccomendation system utilizing Euclidean distance.

This code was part of a larger project done for an Artificial Intelligence course at Belmont University. I am only uploading my euclidean distance code as well as the necessary preprocessing code.

The preprocessing code was done alongside my project partners, Jessica and Persabella. Only the code using Euclidean distance is 100% my individual code.
